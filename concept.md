**This machine is designed to be replicated or improved to enable upcycling of tennis balls in a distributed manner. The plans will be published on GitHub under a free license, with attribution (CC BY 4.0).**

## Concept
_"This machine is designed to be reproduced or improved,"_  
meaning it is designed to be manufactured in other fablabs or makerspaces, or improved and adapted as needed.
The design must therefore exclude the use of non-standard components, or provide information on how to make them.
For example, the vibrating saw is not a Bosch but a Fein or a Makita, and the tool holding clamp does not match and must be adapted to the new shape. The editable 3D model is provided to make the update.  
We select tools like Bosch because the brand is reputable, professional, and readily available.

_"and enable upcycling of tennis balls in a distributed way."_  
Upcycling, as opposed to recycling, means transforming or reusing the ball for a new function than what it was originally intended for. Here, the ball is cut in half and finds a new life and function as sound absorption.

_"Distributed production:"_  
This is the main proposal of Opendesk. Instead of having a centralized factory, they have a network of workshops for distributed production. This way, the production process is decentralized and potentially associated with local networks for decentralized pickup of the products.

## License
_"The plans will be published on GitHub under an open license with attribution (CC BY 4.0)."_  
As a consequence of these goals, the plans must be shared openly so that anyone who wants to participate in the ball cutting can do so.

We propose publishing the plans on GitHub, which is a platform that allows for protection, distribution, and collaboration on software, hardware, and other projects.
