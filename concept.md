**This machine is designed to be replicated or improved to allow up-cycling of tennis balls in a distributed manner. The plans will be published on github under a free license, with attribution (CC BY 4.0).**

## Concept
_"This machine is designed to be reproduced or improved"_  
that is to say, designed to meet the objective of being manufactured in other fablabs, makerspaces or improved, adapted as needed.  
The design must therefore exclude the use of non-standard components or, failing that, provide the information to make them.  
For example, the vibrating saw is not a Bosch but a Fein or a Makita, the tool holding clamp does not match, and must be adapted to the new shape. The editable 3D model is provided to make the update.  
And we select tools like Bosch because the brand is reputable, professional and readily available.

_"and allow up-cycling of tennis balls in a distributed way."_  
upcycling vs. recycling: recycling balls means crushing them and reusing the raw material. upcycling means transforming or reusing the ball for a new function than what it was originally. Here, it is cut in 2 and it finds a new life and another function: sound absorption.

_"distributed production:"_  
This is the main proposal of Opendesk.  
No centralized factory, but a network of workshops for a distributed production, potentially associated with its local network for a decentralized pick-up of balls

_"The plans will be published on github under a open license with attribution (CC BY 4.0)."_  
As a consequence of these goals, the plans must be shared and open so that every place that wants to participate in some way to the ball cutting, can be allowed to do so.   
We propose the most common and suitable way to publish these plans. This is via github, a platform that allows protection, distribution and collaboration on software, hardware and other projects.
