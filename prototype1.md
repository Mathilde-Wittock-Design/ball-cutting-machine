# Prototype No. 1

The first version of the "clamping base" is designed to hold a tennis ball while undergoing a vertical cut with a vibrating saw mounted on a drilling stand. The constraints were as follows:  
1. Keeping the ball properly secured despite its loss of volume and density as successive cuts were made.
2. Properly securing the ball against pressure and vibration.
3. Making a straight cut up to the middle of the ball.

Following the guidelines, our solutions to these different problems were as follows:
1. We opted to hold the ball with a spring-loaded clamp that adapts to the different sizes and density changes of the ball during the operation.
2. We added heavy-duty grip tape to the inside of the clamps, as well as screws whose tips come out inside the clamp, in order to create even more resistance to vibration.
3. We made a right-angle table to install the clamps vertically so that we can cut up to half the ball with no obstruction from the clamp. We added tabs to locate every clamp and ease the alignment with the blade.

## Lists of Components
#### Stand

We opted for this sturdy, rigid, and adjustable drill stand, which allows us to adjust the cutting height and the exact positioning of the vibrating saw. And we chose this model of Bosch multitool for its rigid "starlock" clamping ring that allowed us to hold on to it. The use in a fixed station did not require the cordless version, which offers the advantage of being less expensive.

## Assembly

1. Attach the drilling stand to the workbench using at least two bolts.
2. Attach the adapter to the end of the horizontal hexagonal rod so that it is flush with the edge of the rod.
3. Position the vibrating saw in the adapter, tighten the clamping screw slightly, and insert the blade.
4. Bolt the fixed part of the board to the stand without tightening.
5. Place the movable part of the board against the fixed part in the first notch, place a ball in the first clamp, and adjust the fixed part of the board so that the center of the ball is aligned with the center of the blade.
6. Tighten the fixed part of the board.
7. Close the toggle clamps to lock the position of the movable part, then check the alignment of the blade with the board using a square.
8. Lock the square with a clamp and then firmly screw the saw's clamping screw onto the adapter.
9. Adjust the cutting height (Z-axis) and depth (Y-axis) manually (refer to the drilling stand manual).


## Tablet construction

- Cut the three parts of the tablet to the dimensions indicated on the diagram.
- The two parts of the flat, horizontal face are cut at a 45° angle like a "French cleat" so that the mobile part slides under the fixed part.
- The third part is fixed at a right angle to the second, composing the mobile part of the tablet.
- In the fixed part, drill two holes so that it can be bolted to the base, then fix it.
- Trace the center of the blade on the fixed part, then make a "dovetail" notch centered on the blade.
- Cut out the negative of this notch and stick it inside to obtain a notch.

- Cut out a notch in the mobile part of the tablet corresponding to this notch, for each clamp you wish to put on this tablet, the recommended space between these notches is 12/16 cm to provide space for the clamps but also to place the hand outside the cut.
- Determine the location of the clamps centered opposite the notches of the mobile part, on the vertical part, by already positioning a ball in each, in order to center the ball and not the clamp.
Ensure that the ball protrudes sufficiently in height to pass over the horizontal tablet.
- Mark the location of the clamp and outline the spring housing.
- Remove the clamp and hollow out the spring housing location with a wood chisel in the tablet so that it can fit completely and no longer interfere with the stability of the clamp.
- Place the clamp again and fix it by drilling one of the two handles in three points, in order to keep its ability to open and close while fixing it securely.
