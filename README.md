This project is part of the [Soundbounce Design Project](<https://graduateshowcase.arts.ac.uk/projects/247648/cover>).  
Soundbounce is a product made from reclaimed tennis balls.

## Objectives
The machine should be an assembly of standard tools and accessible to Opendesk manufacturers.  
Opendesk manufacturers are mainly located in North America and Western Europe.  
The machine should be assembled from a downloadable file/template.  

Main objectives:
- [ ] Reduce cutting time.
- [ ] Require minimum effort.
- [ ] Be affordable and accessible.
- [ ] Be safe.

## Propositions
At the moment, the machine can be an adapter that can be attached to a drill press.  
In the future, this machine could probably become an adapter that can be attached to a CNC machine.  
The drill press for cutting tennis balls seems to need an adapter to hold the appropriate cutting tool and a tray to hold the tennis balls in place during cutting.

### Constraints? Guidelines?
Since this is to be shared and intended for makers, it is important to base our choices on repeatability and accessibility.  
Therefore, we need to take into account:  
- Quality brands that are likely to already be in the range of professional makers, such as Fein, Bosch, Makita, and Ryobi.
- Open-source software and easy-to-access documentation that is not paid.
- 3D printing FDM, PLA filament, PETG, and nothing too specific.
