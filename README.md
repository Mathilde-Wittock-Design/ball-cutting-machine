## Objectives
The machine should be an assembly of standard tools and accessible to Opendesk manufacturers.
Opendesk manufacturers are mainly located in North America and Western Europe.
The machine should be assembled from a downloadable file/template.

Main objectives:
- [ ] Reduce cutting time.
- [ ] Minimum effort required.
- [ ] Affordable and accessible.
- [ ] Safe.

## Propositions
At the moment, the machine can be an adapter that can be attached to a drill press.
In the future, this machine could probably become an adapter that can be attached to a CNC machine.
The drill press for cutting tennis balls seems to need an adapter to hold the appropriate cutting tool and a tray to hold the tennis balls in place during cutting.

### Constraints? guidelines?
Since this is to be shared and intended for makers, it is important to base our choices on repeatability and accessibility.
Therefore we need to take in account:
- Quality brands that are likely to be already in the range of professional makers. Fein, Bosch, makita, Ryobi, ....
- opensource software and easy to access documentation, not paid.
- 3D printing FDM, PLA filament, PETG, nothing too specific.
